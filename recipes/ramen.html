                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                        Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish that originated in
                        China but evolved into a distinctly Japanese comfort
                        food.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Ramen varies widely by region in Japan (e.g., Sapporo's
                        miso ramen, Hakata's tonkotsu) and can range from humble
                        street stalls to gourmet creations. Instant ramen (like
                        Top Ramen or Cup Noodles) is a globally popular
                        convenience version.
